# Shared Network Pre-training and Significant Semantic Strengthening for Various Video-Text Tasks (Pytorch)

This repository contains the code for our paper [SNP-S3: Shared Network Pre-training and Significant Semantic Strengthening for Various Video-Text Tasks](), which has been accepted by TCSVT.

## Codebase

Check [CODEBASE.md](CODEBASE.md) for instructions of codebase downloading and model pre-training (SNP-S3).

We have already prepared the codebase, but we still need some time to obtain the external disclosure authorization from our group. The codebase is planned to be published in August 2023.

## Benchmark

Check [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md) for instructions of benchmark downloading and model fine-tuning (SNP-S3).

We have already prepared the benchmark, but we still need some time to obtain the external disclosure authorization from our group. All benchmarks are planned to be published in August 2023.
